# Operating-Systems-Projects

These are the exercises completed during the Operating Systems course, co-created with Eleftheria Tzourmana. They contain programs in C that perform system calls (read()/write() etc), process creaton using s.c. fork() as well as thread creation, and synchronisation using locks and semaphores. The source code hasn't been added yet, however it can be viewed in the reports. The reports haven't been translated to English yet.
