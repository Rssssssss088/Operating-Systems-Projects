# Operating-Systems-Projects

These are the exercises completed during the Operating Systems course. They contain programs in C that perform system calls (read()/write() etc), process creaton using s.c. fork() as well as thread creation, and synchronisation using locks and semaphores. The source code hasn't been added yet, however all the programs can be viewed in the reports. The repotrs haven't been translated yet to English.
